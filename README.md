# LambdaAutoDuper

Lambda Client addon specifically designed to automate the SalC1 dupe. This mod only works on SalC1 dupe enabled servers like 2b2t.au. The implementation is an Kotlin adaptation from the [Creepy Salhack AutoDuperModule](https://github.com/CreepyOrb924/creepy-salhack/blob/master/src/main/java/me/ionar/salhack/module/misc/AutoDuperModule.java) by CreepyOrb924.
